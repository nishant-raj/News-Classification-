# News-Classification-
News are caterogeries into different classes based on ceratain keywords present in the headlines and short description.
I have used 10,000 diffrent news having 7 diffrent attributes divided among 31 different classes.
Datasets are un-evenly distributed among these classes (Almost 31% of data are of Politics and Entertinment category) so i have used SMOTE as over-sampling method to re-distribute the data.
I have used Precision-Recall and F1-Score as a performance metric.
